# Product ID - Usage

The product ID is used to reference the product later in the document and there is no specified format.
The value is usually assigned by the generator.
To make it easier to find errors, it is recommended to use a prefix to distinguish from product group IDs.

The same `product_id` must not be defined more than once in the same document.

The `product_id` should be referenced somewhere within the same documents.
