# Cvss V3 - Usage

* The schema at [https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.json](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.json) resp.
  [https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.json](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.json) must be adhered to.

* The computed values must be correct according to their definition. For this computation, the `vectorString` takes
  precedence over the other properties.

* The given properties must not contradict the CVSS vector.

* If the corresponding product is listed in `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_fixed[]` or
  `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed[]`, the `environmental_score` should be `0`.
