# Product Status - Usage

* The same product ID must not be member of contradicting product status groups. I.e. a product listed in the group of
  _affected_ products may not be listed again in the group of _not affected_ products. The contradicting groups are

  * affected
    ```
    product_status/first_affected[]
    product_status/known_affected[]
    product_status/last_affected[]
    ```

  * not affected
    ```
    product_status/known_not_affected[]
    ```

  * fixed
    ```
    product_status/first_fixed[]
    product_status/fixed[]
    ```

  * under investigation:
    ```
    product_status/under_investigation[]
    ```

  > Note: An issuer might recommend (product_status/recommended) a product version from any group - also from the
  > affected group, i.e. if it was discovered that fixed versions introduce a more severe vulnerability.
