# Category - Specification

Category of the remediation (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` specifies the category which this remediation
belongs to.
Valid values are:

* `mitigation`
* `no_fix_planned`
* `none_available`
* `vendor_fix`
* `workaround`

The value `workaround` indicates that the remediation contains information about a configuration or specific deployment
scenario that can be used to avoid exposure to the vulnerability. There MAY be none, one, or more workarounds available.
This is typically the “first line of defense” against a new vulnerability before a mitigation or vendor fix has been
issued or even discovered.

The value `mitigation` indicates that the remediation contains information about a configuration or deployment scenario
that helps to reduce the risk of the vulnerability but that does not resolve the vulnerability on the affected product.
Mitigations MAY include using devices or access controls external to the affected product. Mitigations MAY or MAY NOT be
issued by the original author of the affected product, and they MAY or MAY NOT be officially sanctioned by the document
producer.

The value `vendor_fix` indicates that the remediation contains information about an official fix that is issued by the
original author of the affected product. Unless otherwise noted, it is assumed that this fix fully resolves the
vulnerability.

The value `none_available` indicates that there is currently no fix available. The description SHOULD contain details
about why there is no fix.

The value `no_fix_planned` indicates that there is no fix for the vulnerability and it is not planned to provide one at
any time. This is often the case when a product has been orphaned, declared end-of-life, or otherwise deprecated. The
description SHOULD contain details about why there will be no fix issued.
