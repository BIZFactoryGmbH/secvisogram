# Known Not Affected - Usage

Lists only non-affected products.

Products that are only not affected in a certain configuration must not be listed here.
These products are considered affected as the user has to check the configuration (which is a remediation and can be described as action statement).

It should always be stated why the products are not affected.

A product listed here must not be listed in any of the following

* `product_status/first_affected[]`
* `product_status/known_affected[]`
* `product_status/last_affected[]`
* `product_status/first_fixed[]`
* `product_status/fixed[]`
* `product_status/under_investigation[]`

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.
