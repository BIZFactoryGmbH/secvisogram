* For the profile `csaf_security_advisory` there must be a `product_status` property for a vulnerability.

* For the profile `csaf_vex` at least one of the properties `cve` or `ids` must be present.

* It is recommended to provide a CVE number (`cve`) to support the users efforts to find more details about a
  vulnerability and potentially track it through multiple advisories. If no CVE exists for that vulnerability, it is
  recommended to get one assigned.
